**Recommendations**
 
!You would have to start with **option 0** (Creation of necessary files), because without the files it will not work.
!When you have finished **option 0**. if you want you can configure the server with **option 1** (Quick setup) this is basic or with **option 2** (Advanced setup). 
!Finally to run the server you will use **option 3** (Start Server). If you want to stop the server use **Ctrl + C** and you will return to the main menu.
