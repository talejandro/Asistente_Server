> cd minecraft_1.18_server_setup_wizard/

3. You have to give the script execution permission: 

> chmod +x ms_setup_wizard.sh

4. When you're done, you run the script: 

> ./ms_setup_wizard.sh

5. When the script starts, you will have to choose the option you want.

**Recommendations**
 

 - You would have to start with **option 0** (Creation of necessary
   files), because without the files it will not work.
 - When you have finished **option 0**. if you want you can configure
   the server with **option 1** (Quick setup) this is basic or with
   **option 2** (Advanced setup).
 - Finally to run the server you will use **option 3** (Start Server).
   If you want to stop the server use **Ctrl + C** and you will return
   to the main menu.
