**Recommendations**
 

 - You would've to start with **option 0** (Creation of necessary files), because without the script it won't work.
 - When you have finished **option 0**, if you want can configure the server with **option 1** (Quick setup) this is very basic or with **option 2** (Advanced setup).
 - Finally to run server you will use **option 3** (Start Server), to stop server use **Ctrl + C** and you will return to the main menu.
